    "- **Classification**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The classification is just look like regression problem, except that the values we now want to predict take on only s small number of discrete values.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Focus on the **binary classification problem** in which y can take on only 2 values 0 and 1. 0 is called \"negative class\" (-), and 1 the \"positive class\" (+).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hypothesis Representation**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Let's change the form for our hypothesis $h_\\theta(x)$ to satisfy $0 \\le h_\\theta(x) \\le 1$. This is accomplished by plugging $\\theta^Tx$ into the Logistic Function (or Sigmoid Function):\n",
    "\n",
    "        $$h_\\theta(x) = g(\\theta^Tx)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "        When: \n",
    "        \n",
    "        $z = \\theta^Tx$\n",
    "        \n",
    "        $g(z) = \\dfrac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - With the sigmoid function, when z go to $-\\infty$, h will go to 0 (actually when z=-5, h will be very near 0) and when z go to $+\\infty$, h will go to 1 (actually when z=5, h will be very near 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - $h_\\theta(x)$ will give us the **probability** that our output is 1. For example, $h_\\theta(x) = 0.7$ gives us a probability of 70% that our output is 1 and 30% that our output is 0.\n",

    "        $h_\\theta(x) = P(y=1|x;\\theta) = 1 - P(y = 0|x;\\theta)$ "
