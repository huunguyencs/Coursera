    "\n",
    "To attempt classification, one method is to use linear regression and map all predictions greater than 0.5 as a 1 and all less than 0.5 as a 0. However, this method doesn't work well because classification is not actually a linear function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classification problem is just like the regression problem, except that the values we now want to predict take on only a small number of discrete values. For now, we will focus on the **binary classification problem** in which y can take on only two values, 0 and 1. (Most of what we say here will also generalize to the multiple-class case.) For instance, if we are trying to build a spam classifier for email, then $x^{(i)}$ may be some features of a piece of email, and y may be 1 if it is a piece of spam mail, and 0 otherwise. Hence, y$\\in${0,1}. 0 is also called the negative class, and 1 the positive class, and they are sometimes also denoted by the symbols “-” and “+.” Given $x^{(i)}$ , the corresponding $y^{(i)}$ is also called the label for the training example.

    "We could approach the classification problem ignoring the fact that y is discrete-valued, and use our old linear regression algorithm to try to predict y given x. However, it is easy to construct examples where this method performs very poorly. Intuitively, it also doesn’t make sense for $h_\\theta (x)$ to take values larger than 1 or smaller than 0 when we know that y $\\in$ {0, 1}. To fix this, let’s change the form for our hypotheses $h_\\theta (x)$ to satisfy $0 \\leq h_\\theta (x) \\leq 1$. This is accomplished by plugging $\\theta^Tx$ into the Logistic Function.\n",
