    "    - Neurons are basically computational units that take inputs (**dendrites**) as electrical inputs that are channeled to outputs (**axons**).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - In neural networks, we use the same logistic function as in classification, $\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\theta^Tx}}$, yet we sometimes call it a signmoid (logistic) **activation** function. In this situation, our \"theta\" parameters are sometimes called \"weights\".\n",
    "\n",
    "    - A simplistic representation looks like:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $[x_0x_1x_2] \\to [ ] \\to h_\\theta(x)$\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Our inputs nodes (layer 1), also known as the \"input layer\", go into another node (layer 2), which finally outputs the hypothesis function, known as the \"output layer\". We can have intermediate layers of nodes between the input and output layers called the \"hidden layers.\"\n",

    "    $\\theta^{(j)} = matrix of weights controlling function mapping from layer j to layer j + 1$\n",

    "    - The values for each of the \"activation\" nodes is obtained as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $a_1^{(2)} = g(\\Theta_{10}^{(1)}x_0 + \\Theta_{11}^{(1)}x_1 + \\Theta_{12}^{(1)}x_2 + \\Theta_{13}^{(1)}x_3)$\n",

    "    - We are multiplying our matrix $\\Theta^{j-1}$ with dimensions $s_jx(n+1)$ by our vector $a^{(j-1)}$ with height (n+1). This gives us our vector $z^{(j)}$ with height $s_j$. Now we can get a vector of our activation nodes for layer j as follows:\n",
