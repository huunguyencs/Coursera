# Interview Questions: Union-Find

1. **Social network connectivity.** Given a social network containing _n_ members and a log file containing _m_ timestamps at which times pairs of members formed friendships, design an algorithm to determine the earliest time at which all members are connected (i.e., every member is a friend of a friend of a friend ... of a friend). Assume that the log file is sorted by timestamp and that friendship is an equivalence relation. The running time of your algorithm should be _m log(n)_ or better and use extra space proportional to _n_.

   **Hint:** union-find.

2. **Union-find with specific canonical element.** Add a method **find()** to the union-find data type so that **find(i)** returns the largest element in the connected component containing _i_. The operations,**union()**, **connected()**, and **find()** should all take logarithmic time or better.

   For example, if one of the connected components is {1,2,6,9}, then the **find()** method should return **9** for each of the four elements in the connected components.

   **Hint:** maintain an extra array to the weighted quick-union data structure that stores for each root **i** the large element in the connected component containing **i**.

3. **Successor with delete.** Given a set of _n_ integers _S = {0, 1, ..., n}_ and a sequence of requests of the following form:

   - Remove _x_ from S
   - Find the _successor_ of _x_: the smallest _y_ in S such that _y_ â‰¥ _x_

   design a data type so that all operations (except construction) take logarithmic time or better in the worst case.

   **Hint:** use the modification of the union-find data discussed in the previous question.
